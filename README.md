<h1>PROJECT REPORT ON ONLINE QUIZZING WEBSITE</h1>

<strong>Preksha Pandey</strong>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

Online Exams are being launched because there is a need for a website
that is beneficial for students who are preparing for JEE and other
similar exams. Often we have seen that the offline examination is time
consuming and the result is often delayed. With this site, students can
give exams and view their results. Thus the purpose of the site is to
provide a system that saves the efforts and time of the students and
providing all these services absolutely free of cost.
